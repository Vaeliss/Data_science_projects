Homework carried out for the optimization for DS exam (20/21).

In a semi-supervised context, different optimization techniques (standard gradient descent, block coordinate variations) are tested.
Particular attention is paid in the efficient implementation and calculations of the problem at hand.
Also many different methods to properly determine the step size and the stopping conditions are tested.
