Project carried out for the exam Cognition and Computation (21/22) in Unipd.

The main objective was to impement simulations to explore computational models of visual learning concepts.
VGG-16 pretrained on ImageNet was hence explored using several visualization techniques.

Some examples are DeepDream, Grad-CAM and image generation to maximize the response for determined filters.
