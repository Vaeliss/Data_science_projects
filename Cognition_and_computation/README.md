Project carried out for the exam Cognition and Computation (21/22).

The main objective was to impement simulations to explore computational models of visual learning concepts.
VGG-16 pretrained on ImageNet was hence explored using several visualization techniques.

Some examples are DeepDream...

...Grad-CAM...

...and visualizations of activations at different levels of depth.
